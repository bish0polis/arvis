## 💬 What is Arvis? why it is needed?

`Arvis` aims to help you run any scripts or binarys very simple.

I've thought many useful alfred-workflows can run in cross-platform So I started to work on this.

`Arvis` also aims to provide a "frame" or "library" to help create such `workflow`, `plugin` more easily.

It is intentionally built similar to Alfred, but there could be some different points.

### 📝 Alfred-workflow Compatibility

* Basically, `Arvis` use same [JSON Scriptfilter Format](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/) with Alfred-workflows.

* This means you may easily change the alfred-workflow to arvis-workflow. 

* Especially if the workflow is builded on [alfy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/alfy), you can convert workflow more easily using [arvish](https://github.com/jopemachine/arvish), the clone version of alfy. 

### ✨ Change appearance

You can change Arvis search window's appearance to some extent.

Click `Appearance` in the Preference window and import the `arvistheme` file or set values on your own.
