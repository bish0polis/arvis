# Workflow introduction

You can replace repetitive task with using `workflow`.

`workflow` is a set of `command` that can be executed.

Each `Action` of `command` can be executed by `trigger` (`keyword`, `scriptfilter`, and `hotkey`).

`Keyword` is to link an `action` to a command.

`Scriptfilter` connects `script` to a command.

and the items returned by the script appear in searchWindow, and the `action` is executed by clicking on them.

`Hotkey` binds a specific key combination to a particular `action`.

Arvis also supports "double" modifier key combinations (e.g. double cmd, double ctrl..)
