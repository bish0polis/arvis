## ðŸŒˆ How to Install

Click [this link](https://github.com/jopemachine/arvis/releases) and download your platform's binary.

Note that you should install some [Extensions](#take-a-look-at-useful-workflows-plugins) to use Arvis.

### Installation issues

* Install [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) before install arvis.

### Recommends

* Recommend to install [Node 12](https://nodejs.org/ko/download/) or higher because lots of extensions use Node.
